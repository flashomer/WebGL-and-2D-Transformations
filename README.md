# Introduction to WebGL, WebGL
In this assignment you will practice WebGL and 2D Transformations. There are mainly 3 parts.

1. Draw your initials: Make two 2D shapes that look like your initials. For instance, my name is Abdullah Bulbul so I draw two letters A and B. If your name is Mehmet Yılmaz you need to draw M and Y. Letters don’t
need to be perfect but they should be centered on the screen.

2. 2D transformations: Implement translation, scale, and rotation. When you scale or rotate, the letters need to be transformed locally (position shouldn’t change).

3. Colors: Change color of the letters using the color controls. In the end, your program needs to work as in the assignment video.
